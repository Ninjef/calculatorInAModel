# Overview

This repo is intended as a research sandbox. The thesis being researched is related to connecting non-differentiable tools into a neural network such that both the inputs and outputs to the tool are connected directly to the internal workings of the network. We are trying to see if we can get a simple calculator tool to sit within a neural network and whether the network can learn to use it.

# Progress

So far, we've found that if we use an "oracle" approach to give the calculator the correct output for whatever math question comes in, the downstream nodes can absolutely learn to answer the question (no surprise). However, because tools are typically non-differentiable, the upstream neurons have not yet shown an ability to learn how to provide inputs into the calculator such that the network's ability to do math succeeds. We have only heavily tried STE, but there are many other possible approaches available.

# Navigation
You can find a valuable set of fact sheets in factSheets/, which keeps track of all the learnings of past experiments by experiment phase
Under aiAgentWorkHistory, we have all the work performed in the past.
Under aiAgentProjectTasks, we have all the intended work to be done by the researchers, completed ones in the completed folder.
