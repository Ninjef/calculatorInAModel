# Hypothesis Ledger

Tiny claims and outcomes to prevent retesting settled branches.

## Phase 7

DISPROVEN: Vanilla result-space policy gradient is mainly blocked by finite-sample variance.
Conclusion: Exact result-marginal gradients align with sampled PG but both anti-align with the boundary ceiling.
Do not repeat: Longer vanilla PG or learned-baseline runs that estimate the same raw expected-cost gradient.
Next allowed test: A qualitatively different backward channel with a fixed-grid alignment gate.

DISPROVEN: Decoder calibration alone rescues ordinary expected-cost discovery.
Conclusion: Contrastive-margin decoder passed local sign alignment, then Stage 1 collapsed to wrong low-entropy results.
Do not repeat: Decoder-only sharpening/calibration without a stronger backward channel.
Next allowed test: Synthetic gradients, direct feedback alignment, or learned shadow-gradient modules.

DISPROVEN: Output-projection boundary feedback is sufficient for natural result-space discovery.
Conclusion: Stage 0 aligned with the boundary ceiling, but Stage 1 reached only `0.155` best snapshot calculator-result accuracy and `0.160` final exact match.
Do not repeat: Plain output-projection feedback with the same weight/schedule as a mainline long run.
Next allowed test: A learned shadow-gradient module or stronger feedback training objective that must pass Stage 0 and show early Stage 1 lift.

DISPROVEN: One fixed-random direct-feedback matrix is enough to clear the Stage 0 result-head gate.
Conclusion: Seed `0` fixed-random feedback had result-head cosine `-0.0036` against the boundary ceiling despite positive upstream cosine.
Do not repeat: Single-seed fixed-random DFA long training without a positive result-head Stage 0 gate.
Next allowed test: Multi-seed random-feedback screening or learned feedback, but only with Stage 0 gating.
